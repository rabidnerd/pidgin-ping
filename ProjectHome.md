Requires Net::Purple, Net::PingFM

Based on [pidgin-status-to-twitter](http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-status-to-twitter/)

Please note that this plugin requires Perl. On Windows, you can download, install and use [ActiveState Perl](http://www.activestate.com) and it's Package Manager to install the Required Purple and PingFM packages.

This plugin does not come with an installer, and should be placed in the "Plugins" directory of your Pidgin installation. On Windows, this would likely be in C:\Program Files\Pidgin\Plugins.

(**nix users are assumed to have Perl and know where to place the file)**
